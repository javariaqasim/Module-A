        <p><img src="./images/1_j09PgBpdJIHXhlyjcby0HA.jpeg" alt="" width="100%"></p>
        <h4 class="b">We have state of the art multi slicer computed tomography machine and offer a wide<br> spectrum of scanning protocols from plain CT brain to limb angiography and cisternography<br>
            We cater to in-patients, out-patients and emergency department, with prompt scanning and<br> report turnaround time. Direct communication and sharing of preliminary findings with the<br> primary physician is our practice.</h4>
            <h3>WHAT IS CT SCANNING OF THE BODY?</h3>
            <h5 class="b">Computed tomography, more commonly known as a CT or CAT scan, is a diagnostic<br> medical test that, like traditional x-rays, produces multiple images or pictures of the inside<br> of the body. <br>
            The cross-sectional images generated during a CT scan can be reformatted in multiple<br> planes, and can even generate three-dimensional images. These images can be viewed <br>on a computer monitor, printed on film or transferred to a CD or DVD.</h5>
            <h3>WHAT ARE SOME COMMON USES OF THE PROCEDURE?</h3>
            <h4>CT imaging is:</h4>
            <h5 class="b">One of the fastest and most accurate tools for examining the chest, abdomen and pelvis<br> because it provides detailed, cross-sectional views of all types of tissue. <br>
            Used to examine patients with injuries from trauma such as a motor vehicle accident.<br>
            Performed on patients with acute symptoms such as chest or abdominal pain or difficulty breathing. <br>
            Often the best method for detecting many different cancers, such as lymphoma<br> and cancers of the lung, liver, kidney, ovary and pancreas since the image allows a physician<br> to confirm the presence of a tumor, measure its size, identify its precise location and <br>determine the extent of its involvement with other nearby tissue. <br>
            </h5>
            <h3>HOW SHOULD I PREPARE?</h3>
            <h5 class="b">You should wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing to your exam. You may be given a <br> gown to wear during the procedure. <br>
            Metal objects, including jewelry, eyeglasses, dentures and hairpins, may affect the CT<br> images and should be left at home or removed prior to your exam. You may also be<br> asked to remove hearing aids and removable dental work. Women will be asked to <br> remove bras containing metal underwire. You may be asked to remove any piercings, if <br>possible.</h5>
            <h3>WHAT DOES THE EQUIPMENT LOOK LIKE?</h3>
            <h5 class="b">The CT scanner is typically a large, box-like machine with a hole, or short tunnel, in the<br> center. You will lie on a narrow examination table that slides into and out of this tunnel.<br> Rotating around you, the x-ray tube and electronic x-ray detectors are located opposite<br> each other in a ring, called a gantry. The computer workstation that processes the <br>imaging information is located in a separate control room, where the technologist<br> operates the scanner and monitors your examination in direct visual contact and usually<br> with the ability to hear and talk to you with the use of a speaker and microphone.</h5>
            <h3>WHAT ARE THE BENIFITS VS RISKS</h3>
            <h4>Benifits</h4>
            <h5 class="b">CT scanning is painless, noninvasive and accurate. <br>
            A major advantage of CT is its ability to image bone, soft tissue and blood vessels all at <br>
            the same time. <br>
            Unlike conventional x-rays, CT scanning provides very detailed images of many types of <br>
            tissue as well as the lungs, bones, and blood vessels. <br>
            CT examinations are fast and simple; in emergency cases, they can reveal internal <br>
            injuries and bleeding quickly enough to help save lives. <br>
            CT has been shown to be a cost-effective imaging tool for a wide range of clinical <br>
            problems. <br>
            CT is less sensitive to patient movement than MRI. <br>
            CT can be performed if you have an implanted medical device of any kind, unlike MRI. <br>
            No radiation remains in a patientâ€™s body after a CT examination <br>
            X-rays used in CT scans should have no immediate side effects.
            </h5>
            <h4>Risks</h4>
            <h5 class="b">
            There is no conclusive evidence that radiation at small amounts delivered by a CT scan <br>causes cancer. Large population studies have shown a slight increase in cancer from<br> much larger amounts of radiation, such as from radiation therapy. Thus, there is always<br> concern that this risk may also apply to the lower amounts of radiation delivered by a CT <br>exam. When a CT scan is recommended by your doctor, the expected benefit of this test <br> outweighs the potential risk from radiation. You are encouraged to discuss the risks<br> versus the benefits of your CT scan with your doctor, and to explore whether alternative <br> imaging tests may be available to diagnose your condition.
            </h5>
            <h3>WHAT ARE THE LAMITATIONS OF CT SCANNING OF THE BODY?</h3>
            <h5 class="b">Soft-tissue details in areas such as the brain, internal pelvic organs, and joints (such as<br> knees and shoulders) can often be better evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging<br> (MRI). In pregnant women, while CT can be performed safely, other imaging exams not<br> involving radiation, such as ultrasound or MRI, are preferred but only if they are likely to<br> be as good as CT in diagnosing your condition.</h5>
