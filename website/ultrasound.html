        <h1>ULTRASOUND</h1>
        <p><img src="./images/image002.jpg" alt="" width="100%"></p>
        <h3>WHAT IS AN ULTRASOUND?</h3>
        <h5 class="b">An ultrasound scan is a medical test that uses high-frequency sound waves to capture<br> live images from the inside of your body.<br>
            An ultrasound allows your doctor to see problems with organs, vessels, and tissues—<br>without needing to make an incision.<br>
            Unlike other imaging techniques, ultrasound uses no radiation, so it is the preferred and<br> safe method for viewing a developing fetus during pregnancy and other fetal congenital<br> abnormalities.
            Ultrasound is also known as sonography.An ultrasound is also a helpful way to guide<br> surgeons’ movements during certain medical procedures, such as biopsies.</h5>
        <h3>DOPPLER ULTRASOUND?</h3>
        <h5 class="b">A vascular ultrasound (or Doppler ultrasound) is an exam that uses high-frequency sound <br>waves to produce a picture or graph of blood as it flows through a blood vessel. It helps <br>in diagnosis of:
            <br>
            Blockages to blood flow (such as clots);
            <br>
            Narrowing of vessels (which may be caused by plaque);
            <br>
            Tumors and congenital malformation</h5>
        <h3>WHY AN ULTRASOUND IS PERFORMED?</h3>
        <h5 class="b">Most people associate ultrasound scans with pregnancy. These scans can provide an<br> expectant mother with the first view of her unborn child. However, the test has many<br> other uses.<br>
            According to the Radiological Society of North America, your doctor may order an<br> ultrasound if you are experiencing pain, swelling, or other symptoms that require an<br> internal view of your organs (RSNA, 2012). An ultrasound can provide a view of the:<br>
            <br>
            Abdominal viscera (Liver, Gall bladder, Spleen, Pancreas, Kidneys and Urinary <br>bladder
            <br>
            Pelvic viscera (Prostate, Uterus and ovaries)
            <br>
            Brain (in infants)
            <br>
            Eyes (B-scan)
            <br>
            Thyroid
            <br>
            Testicles
            <br>
            Blood vessels
            <br>
            Small parts (breasts, muscles, joints and tendon)
            <br>
            Ultrasound guided procedures (fine needle aspiration, trucut biopsy, drain placement <br> etc)</h5>
        <h3>HOW TO PREPARE FOR AN ULTRASOUND?</h3>
        <h5 class="b">The steps you will take to prepare for an ultrasound will depend on the area or organ<br> that is being examined. <br>
        <br>
        Your doctor may tell you to fast for 8 to 12 hours before your ultrasound, especially if<br> your abdomen is being examined. Undigested food can block the sound waves,<br> making it difficult for the doctors to get a clear picture.<br>
        <br>
        If you are having an ultrasound of any of the following:<br>
        GALLBLADDER / ABDOMEN / AORTA / LIVER / PANCREAS / SPLEEN /<br> KIDNEYS, Please do not eat or drink 8 – 12 hours prior to exam. You may be told to<br> eat a fat-free meal the evening before your test and then to fast until the procedure.<br> However, you can continue to drink water and take any medications as instructed.</h5>
